# Chapter02 _ Learing Technical Skills for a Promising AI Career
    How to build career in AI, Andrew Ng 

1. Foundational machine learning skills 
  - Important to understand models and core concepts behind how and why machine learning works
  - models such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, dicision trees, clustering, and anomaly detection.
  - core concepts like bias/variance, cost functions, regulariztion, optimiztion algorithms, and erro analysis

2. Deep learing 
  - basic of neural networks
  - practical skills for making them work (hyperparameter tuning)
  - convolutional networks, sequence models, and transformers.
  
3. Math relevant to machine learning 
    - Linnear Algebra (vectors, matrices, and vaious manipulations of them)
    - Probability and Statistics ( discrete and continuos probability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayer's rule, and hypothesis testing)
    - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
      - useful in data-centric AI development
    - basic intuitive understanding of calculus

4. Software development 
    - programming fundamentals
    - data structures (especially those related to maching learning like data frames)
    - algorithms (including databases and data manipulation)
    - software design
    - familiarity with Python
    - familiarity wirh key libraries such as Tensorflow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn
