    How to build career in AI, Andrew Ng 

- Understanding the math behind algorithms is helpful.
- Able to debug

- Deep learning 
- when training neural network and the optimization algorithm 
- math behind 
- [gradient descent](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/neural-networks-deep-learning/gradient-descent-A0tBd), 
- [momentum](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/gradient-descent-with-momentum-y0m1f), 
- and [the Adam](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/adam-optimization-algorithm-w9VCZ) optimization algorithm
